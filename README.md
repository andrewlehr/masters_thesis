# Analysis of non-stationary signals with applications to local field potentials
## by Andrew Lehr

This repository contains all of the code (as jupyter notebooks) to produce the figures in my masters thesis. One needs standard libraries like numpy, matplotlib, stats, and so on. One also needs the [PyEMD library](https://github.com/laszukdawid/PyEMD) to apply the empirical mode decomposition.
